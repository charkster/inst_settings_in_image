# inst_settings_in_image.py
This is a collection of methods to query lab instrument settings and save them in a PNG image file. The file can be used later to restore all the lab instrument settings.
The idea is to embed all connected instrument settings in an oscilloscope screen capture. It is done using a JSON database which is also human readable. The instrument settings are a list of scpi commands which uniquely define the instrument state. In order to make the list of scpi commands as short as possible, a pthyon class for each instrument is needed that implements get_unique_scpi(). Presently I have 3 instruments completed (they are separate repositories). Oscilloscope settings are next on my list to add... I have a generic approach of defining dictionaries for the channel, measurement and triggering setup.

The end goal is to have a single file, a oscilloscope screen capture, which can be used to restore the instruments to the configuration that was used at the time the screen capture was made. I also have a generic approach of defining the DUT state, which would help get the DUT get into the state where the oscilloscope capture was made. This is not perfect, I can't capture the probe or cable connections, but I would be happy with getting 90% the way there.
